During DNS resolution, DNS messages are sent from DNS clients to DNS servers or between DNS servers. Messages are sent over UDP and DNS servers bind to UDP port 53. When the message length exceeds the default message size for a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagram (512 octets), the first response to the message is sent with as much data as the UDP datagram will allow, and then the DNS server sets a flag indicating a truncated response. The message sender can then choose to reissue the request to the DNS server using TCP (over TCP port 53). The benefit of this approach is that it takes advantage of the performance of UDP but also has a backup failover solution for longer queries.","2018-02-07","",

For Configuration Management (CM) purposes it's intended to be the single repository for all TEST enterprise fw rules.  The TEST-ALL will NOT be the production policy, rather it will be duplicated renamed to each of the fw polices (DC, EX, BU, SVR, HBSS, WKSTN) with the unnessesary sub-groups will be delelted (ie, the HBSS policy doesnt need Exchange rules/group or Domain Controller rules).  TEST-ALL provides a master file for all TEST Enterprise firewall changes.
