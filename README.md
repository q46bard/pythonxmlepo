Python script for converting McAfee ePO HBSS XML files to CSV 
Hi All,
I am not a Python now PowerShell scripting expert. However, I am willing to learn to imporce some archaic processes here at work.
I submitted this script with authorization from the orginal creaters of this script.
I am requesting some help with further refining the script to better suit my needs at work.
Right now, I need help with having the Last Modifying User name value print to the CSV. I was able to rearrange some of the columns and add the Last Modified Date from the original version but the user name value is eluding me.

Eventually, I would like for this script to have the following updates and also be converted to PowerShell:

1.	Add the Last modifying user name value 
2.	Set to run with no parameters (options)
a.	Options from batch script
3.	Set to run by date since  (options)
4.	Set to run by group rule  (options)

Long-term updates
1.	IPS
a.	Process Name
b.	Executable=Process Path
c.	Advance Parameters
2.	Parse VSE XML
3.	Parse Solidcore MAC XMLs
4.	Convert Python script to PowerShell
5.	Create stand-alone XML editor
6.	Convert CSV back to XML
a.	Allow edits of CSV
b.	Convert back to XML for import into ePO
